# Eyewear-ML-Model
The India Today Group Machine Learning Challenge

1. Run the preprocessing file and get the processed data ready for the ML models.  

2. We first consider the Task 2 files (A and B):
  -Task 2 A.py contains the ML model to classify the eyewear according to the frame shape. Save the Model after running the file.
  -Task 2 B.py contains the ML model to classify the eyewear according to parent category. Save the Model after running the file. 

3. Task 1 implements the model developed in Task 2 B to find 10 similar images.
4. Finally we run the app.py as a localhost to view the application.
